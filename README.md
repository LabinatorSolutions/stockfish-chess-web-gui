## Overview

It is a web graphical user interface (GUI) for the Stockfish Chess engine. It is a fully functional web-based chess app that allows you to play against the Stockfish chess engine.

This repository contains three different implementations. The third one is under construction. Explore both and contribute to the one you find most interesting. Ultimately, the third implementation will remain once we reach a stable, bug-free version with sufficient features to be considered professional.
