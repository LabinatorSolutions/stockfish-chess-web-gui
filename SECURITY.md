- **Code Review:** All changes to the codebase are reviewed by at least one other developer to identify potential security issues.
- **Dependencies:** We regularly update our dependencies to resolve known vulnerabilities.
- **Data Protection:** We ensure that sensitive data, including user information, is securely handled and transmitted.
- **Access Control:** We restrict access to the production environment and sensitive data to authorized personnel only.
